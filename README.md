# Comparative Analysis of Nigerian vs Global Agricultural Metrics

A data-driven project comparing Nigeria’s agricultural performance with global standards. The analysis will include yield performance, production trends, and trade dependency insights. The project will be developed in small, structured phases using Excel and Power BI.

## Project Roadmap

This project will be completed in the following structured phases:

1. Project Setup
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
4. Data Modeling
5. Visualizations
6. Insights & Reporting
7. Final Dashboard & Portfolio Presentation

### Agricultural Data (Local & Global Benchmarks)

The `nigeria-agriculture-Project.xlsx` file contains both:

1️⃣ Nigerian agricultural production records  
2️⃣ Global benchmark yield data for the same crops

Dataset includes:
- Product name and type
- Production year (2018 – 2025)
- Local agricultural metrics (yield, area, total tons)
- Global yield benchmarks for comparison
- State/LGA geographic information for mapping
- Crop classification categories
