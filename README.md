# Comparative Analysis of Nigerian vs Global Agricultural Metrics

A data-driven project comparing Nigeria’s agricultural performance with global standards. The analysis will include yield performance, production trends, and trade dependency insights. The project will be developed in small, structured phases using Excel and Power BI.

## Project Roadmap

This project will be completed in the following structured phases:

1. Project Setup
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
4. Data Modeling
5. Visualizations
6. Insights & Reporting
7. Final Dashboard & Portfolio Presentation

### Agricultural Data (Local & Global Benchmarks)

The `nigeria-agriculture-Project.xlsx` file contains both:

1️⃣ Nigerian agricultural production records  
2️⃣ Global benchmark yield data for the same crops

Dataset includes:
- Product name and type
- Production year (2018 – 2025)
- Local agricultural metrics (yield, area, total tons)
- Global yield benchmarks for comparison
- State/LGA geographic information for mapping
- Crop classification categories

## Data Cleaning Plan

The raw data will be prepared for analysis in the following steps:

- Standardize column names and data formats
- Remove duplicates or incorrect records
- Separate local and global metrics into structured tables
- Convert the Excel source into multiple clean CSV datasets
- Ensure relationships can be built in Power BI (using Product ID as key)
- Validate the accuracy of AI-generated fields

## Key Insights

Nigeria shows strong agricultural potential but continues to lag behind global benchmarks in productivity. Most crops operate below 50% of global yield performance, signaling opportunities for technological improvement and better farming practices.

Trade analysis indicates that while crops like onions, rice, palm oil, shea butter, cashew, and pineapples perform well locally, essential commodities such as milk, wheat, and sugar remain heavily import-dependent. This import pressure creates food security vulnerabilities and restricts export growth.

Between 2018 and 2025, Nigeria achieved a modest improvement in yield, but the gap against global averages remains wide. Closing even a small portion of this yield gap would significantly increase food supply, boost earnings for farmers, and reduce foreign dependency.
