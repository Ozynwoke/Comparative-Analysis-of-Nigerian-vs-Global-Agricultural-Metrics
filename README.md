# Comparative Analysis of Nigerian vs Global Agricultural Metrics

A data-driven project comparing Nigeria’s agricultural performance with global standards. The analysis will include yield performance, production trends, and trade dependency insights. The project will be developed in small, structured phases using Excel and Power BI.

## Project Roadmap

This project will be completed in the following structured phases:

1. Project Setup
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
4. Data Modeling
5. Visualizations
6. Insights & Reporting
7. Final Dashboard & Portfolio Presentation

### Agricultural Data (Local & Global Benchmarks)

The `nigeria-agriculture-Project.xlsx` file contains both:

1️⃣ Nigerian agricultural production records  
2️⃣ Global benchmark yield data for the same crops

Dataset includes:
- Product name and type
- Production year (2018 – 2025)
- Local agricultural metrics (yield, area, total tons)
- Global yield benchmarks for comparison
- State/LGA geographic information for mapping
- Crop classification categories

## Data Cleaning Plan

The raw data will be prepared for analysis in the following steps:

- Standardize column names and data formats
- Remove duplicates or incorrect records
- Separate local and global metrics into structured tables
- Convert the Excel source into multiple clean CSV datasets
- Ensure relationships can be built in Power BI (using Product ID as key)
- Validate the accuracy of AI-generated fields

## Data Modeling Plan

The data will be organized in Power BI using Product ID as the main key to link:
- Local production data
- Global benchmark yield data
- Trade and dependence information

These relationships will be used to create a star-schema style model for clearer analysis.
